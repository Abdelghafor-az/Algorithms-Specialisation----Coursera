/*                  Contraction Algorithm
            a randomized graph algorithm to count the minimum cut
    the idea is to choose a randome edge and fuse the 2 connected node into one, modify the
            edges of the graph, and delet any self loop if exist
        repeat the same process/aproach until you are left with 2 vertices
